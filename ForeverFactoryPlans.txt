item class
source class
factory class

link items and sources
factories need inventories

need a day system

factory container of sources and amounts
factory container of products and amounts
factory container of employees and amounts?

keep track of each type and amounts, dictionary with names as keys

factory.storage['apple'] return amount

products and sources have a basic type (fruit, tree), specific type (apple, apple tree), and quality (slow, faster, fast) or maybe it's a multiplier

('apple tree', 1) : 1
'level one apple' : (apple, 1, 5)
